# Statistics-Portfolio
This reflects my ability to do all of the things required by the learning outcomes of Fishers learning outcomes in Fisher's Statistics program.

## **Goal #1 Statistical Methods and Theory**
- Students will demonstrate competency in designing studies, using graphical and statistical methods to explore data, fitting and evaluating statistical models, using inference procedures including resampling methods, and drawing appropriate conclusions from the analysis. 


1. Design a study capable of testing a causal hypothesis and explain how study design is related to evidence for and conclusions about a hypothesis.

One project that I completed was the Gummy bear project that I worked on in Experimental Design (Stat 220). For this project we were tasked to set up and run and experiment that would allow one to see how launch angle of a gummy bear effects the distance in which a gummy bear will travel when launched. This was rather simple considering all we had to do was launch a gummy bear multiple times at a series of fixed launch angels (In our case, the number of blocks we used when launching). Once we collected the data imported it into Rstudio for analysis. We then ran analysis of variance on the distance variable according to launch angle. As one with basic physisics knowledge would tell us, our p-value indicated the relationship was significant at the 95% confidence level. This code is available in the repository under the file name D24 Gummy Bears Factorial.Rmd.

2. Use graphical methods to summarize univariate and bivariate distributions and develop insights through graphical data summaries.

For my reserach experiance for undergraduates (REU) oppurtunity in the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college, I worked a lot with graphical analysis. My summer research project had to do with modeling the shifts is the correlation coeffiecient distributions given different levels of Type II Censoring severity. Very early in the project I had to graphically show how the distribution of correlation coefficients changed with the level of censoring they were exposed to. I mainly did this through through the use of historgrams. Later in the project I was worked on fitting distiributions with an approximate beta distribution. I then had to graphically show how the parameters of the Beta distribution changed with the adustment of the parameters I was using to simulated the correlation coefficients. These graphs are available in the repository____________ (add to repository).

3. Demonstrate competency in fitting and interpreting statistical models for both continuous and categorical outcome variables.

Continuing to dicuss the research I conducted at my REU, I also worked with modeling with the data I simulated. I attempted to precict the alpha and beta parameters used to create a beta distribution based on the parameters in my simulation. In my preliminary model I only used continuous varibales, however, after I decided to cluster my data I added a catagorical variable to help my model. Adding the catagorical variable to my model greatly improved my model. These models are available in the repository under the names_____ with a paper accompanying the models and my reasearch under the name_____.

4. Use resampling methods for statistical inference, including parameter estimation and hypothesis testing.

## **Goal #2 Data Science**
- Students will demonstrate competence in statistical programming, algorithmic thinking, simulation-based statistical techniques, and skills for managing and manipulating data and doing reproducible statistical science.

1. Develop fluency in one statistical programming language and gain familiarity with a second language.

The code that I have posted in my repository shows that I have a fluency in R. I have shown on numerous occasions I am able to conduct every process I need to to complete a project. I also have gained a familiarity with java from taking a computer science class.

2.Translate a data analytic problem into a set of computational steps, and show how they work in real data.
