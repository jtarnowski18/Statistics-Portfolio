# Statistics-Portfolio
This reflects my ability to do all of the things required by the learning outcomes of Fishers learning outcomes in Fisher's Statistics program.

## **Goal #1 Statistical Methods and Theory**
- Students will demonstrate competency in designing studies, using graphical and statistical methods to explore data, fitting and evaluating statistical models, using inference procedures including resampling methods, and drawing appropriate conclusions from the analysis. 


1. Design a study capable of testing a causal hypothesis and explain how study design is related to evidence for and conclusions about a hypothesis.

One project that I completed was the Gummy bear project that I worked on in Experimental Design (Stat 220). For this project we were tasked to set up and run and experiment that would allow one to see how launch angle of a gummy bear effects the distance in which a gummy bear will travel when launched. This was rather simple considering all we had to do was launch a gummy bear multiple times at a series of fixed launch angels (In our case, the number of blocks we used when launching). Once we collected the data imported it into Rstudio for analysis. We then ran analysis of variance on the distance variable according to launch angle. As one with basic physisics knowledge would tell us, our p-value indicated the relationship was significant at the 95% confidence level. This code is available in the
